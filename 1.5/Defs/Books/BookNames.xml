			<li>desc->â€œA mercer called Sheffield was from the north of England. He went into a house and asked the "good wyf" if he could buy some "egges". She replied that she could not speak French, which annoyed him, as he could also not speak French. A bystander suggested that Sheffield was asking for "eyren", which the woman said she understood

Lo, what should a man in these days write: egges or eyren? Certainly it is hard to please every man because of diversity and change of language."</li>
